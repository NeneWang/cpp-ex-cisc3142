# Classes

### Why do classes exists?

- They provide a way of abstracting data and also hiding (i.e. encapsulation) certain data from some sections of code.
- This way we can separate the interface (what a user of a class can execute) and implementation (the data and functions that are used to define a class).
- Although every member must be declared inside its class, we can define a member functionâ€™s body either inside or outside of the class body.
